Rules for contributing... uhh... there aren't?  (just kidding). I am brand new at python, but I have coded in HTML, C+, JavaScript in the past.

This will be updated as I go along, I guess right now just use common sense ya know? This is just a personal begginer project. 
So ANYONE can contribute, you see a typo, or a way to clean up the code... awesome!

For code commits... idk how we'll handle that, if anyone even contributes. But I'm hoping that people contribute, etc. 

So, working on the python script that will scan large files, and ask if you want to delete them etc. I plan to implement this with Rasa open source to make a basic chatbot.
The training of the Rasa bot is an entirely different aspect of the project, and I seem to understand YAML better.

Go easy on me, that's the main rule lol.  :)
