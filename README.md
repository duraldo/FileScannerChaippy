  Feel free to add comments, suggestions. I would say this .py file is 85% me from scratch and 15% chatGPT filling in certain things I didn't understand.
  Being upfront, though I could have done it from scratch, my logic in it was sound, but chatgpt just helps my code look cleaner (and also not take another 20 hours to figureout
